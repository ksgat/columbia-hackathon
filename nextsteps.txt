great, for demonstration purposes, when a user creates a prediction market and creates some predictions people could bet on, please also add five other npc
players that simulate the actions of real players. this is for demonstration purposes for the hackathon. 

secondly, please add some aesthetic color schemes. here is the color scheme: Soft Mint Green #D1E8E2
Dark Cyan #19747E
Light Blue #A9D6E5
Platinum #E2E2E2

additionally, on each prediction, there should be a historical chart of the value of the prediciotn (yes/no) over time. this hsould also apply ot 
chained or derivative markets (options). 

then, when a user places a bet, the value of the bet should be subtracted from their total balance.
